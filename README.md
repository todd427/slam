I'll help you build SLAM - this is a really well-defined MVP! Let me start by reading the relevant skills for creating a production-quality web application.Perfect! Now I'll create SLAM - a bridge opening-bid trainer. Based on the PRD, I'll build a distinctive, focused web app with these key features:

**Design Direction**: Clean, focused, and confidence-building - like a personal bridge coach. I'll use:
- **Aesthetic**: Refined minimal with purposeful accent colors (green for success, card suit colors)
- **Typography**: A distinctive serif for headers (Playfair Display) paired with clean sans-serif (DM Sans)
- **Color**: Deep navy base with vibrant suit colors and success/error states
- **Interaction**: Smooth transitions, clear feedback states, micro-animations on success

Let me build this as a single-file React artifact with the complete MVP functionality:Perfect! Now let me copy this to the outputs directory so you can use it:# SLAM Bridge MVP ✓
